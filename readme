The following steps are followed:
keras2c
This is a bunch of code to port the Keras neural network model into pure C. Neural network weights and architecture are stored in plain text files and input is presented as a vector.

Usage
save your network weights and architecture.
Dump network structure to a plain text file with dump_to_simple_cpp.py script.
Use network with code from keras_model.h and keras_model.cc files - please take a look at the example below.
use the weight and bias from the Kerastoc and find the output (Nu) from the c code.

Example
Run one iteration of simple DNN data with example/main_code_1.py script. It will produce files with architecture example/my_nn_arch.json and weights in HDF5 format example/my_nn_weights.h5.
Dump network to plain text file python main_code_2.py.py -a example/my_nn_arch.json -w example/my_nn_weights.h5 -o example/dumped.net.
Compile example g++ -std=c++11 keras_model.cc example_main.cc - see code in example_main.cc.
Run binary ./a.out - you should get the same output as in step one from Keras.

Testing
If you want to test dumping for your network, please use test_run.sh script. Please provide there your network architecture and weights. The script does the following job:

Dump the network into a text file.
Generate a random sample.
Compute predictions from keras and keras2cpp on the generated sample.
Compare predictions.
